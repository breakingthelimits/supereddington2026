  <h3>
  Code of conduct for Breaking the Limits 2025
  </h3>
      <p>We value the participation of everyone at this conference and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling
        experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees and staff.<br/><br/>

        As such, <i>Breaking the Limits 2025 </i> will be a harassment-free event for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, religion. We do not tolerate harassment
        of attendees in any form.<br/>

        </p>

        <UL>
          <LI>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
            appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
            following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
            inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</LI><br/>
          <LI>All comunication given by lecturers, organisers and attendees should be appropriate for a professional
              audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language, jokes and imagery is not appropriate
              for any event.</LI><br/>
          <LI>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.</LI><br/>
          <LI>Respect the staff.</LI><br/>
          <LI>Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</LI><br/>

        </UL>

        <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating the
        harassment rules may be asked to leave the event, without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.<br/><br/>

        In addition to this, please keep in mind that presenters give their time freely, many have travelled a considerable
        distance, some are very distinguished, some are early career scientists perhaps presenting their work at this level
        for the first time, and all deserve a fair and encouraging hearing. Please try to be on time for the start of a
        session, refrain from loud conversations outside the doors, mute mobile phones, and if you must use a lap-top computer
        do so inconspicuously. <br/><br/>

        Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, respectful space for all. <br/><br/>
