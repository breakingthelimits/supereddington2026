# Breaking the limits III: Super Eddington 2024

Recent years have seen an increasing interest of the astronomical community
on the topic of super-Eddington accretion on compact objects, which can
apply to a variety of systems, such as supermassive black holes, black hole
binaries, ULXs, neutron stars. Moreover, the possibility that the Eddington
limit may be violated can have important implications for the related topics
of black hole growth, galaxy evolution and AGN feedback.
After the two successful editions in 2016 and 2018 and a long post-COVID hiatus, we reconvene to
discuss the advancement done in the last six years. This workshop will be an
opportunity to compare recent observations with state-of-the-art
theoretical modeling of super-Eddington flows, and to discuss the
cosmological implications of this regime of accretion.
